# Caching Proxy Server

## 🎯 Overview

The **Caching Proxy Server** is a CLI tool built with Django. It forwards HTTP requests to an origin server and caches the responses. If a request is repeated, the cached response is served to enhance performance and reduce load on the origin server.
https://roadmap.sh/projects/caching-server
## 🚀 Features

- **Forward Requests:** Directs incoming requests to the specified origin server.
- **Cache Responses:** Stores responses to speed up repeated requests.
- **Cache Headers:** Indicates cache status with headers.
- **Cache Clearing:** Command to clear the cached responses.

## 🛠 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caching-proxy.git
   cd caching-proxy
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage
